Title: Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

Description:
In the Kaggle Titanic competition, I used logistic regression to predict the survival status of passengers. By analyzing passenger attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, and family size, I developed a model that estimated the probability of survival. With data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, my approach aimed to accurately classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. Through this project, I showcased my ability to leverage logistic regression for binary classification tasks and gained valuable experience in data analysis and predictive modeling.
